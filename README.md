# hola talk

first delivery: at FuerteVentura, during Agile Nomads

**title**: ¡Hola!(cracy)🤙: a way to self manage organizations explained and experienced 🏄

**abstract** 
A new wave of organizations has embraced self management systems as opposed to a traditional hierarchical managing system. In this talk I will explain one such system called Holacracy that we use in our company (AgileLab). If you think organizations should evolve and there is room for a better way of working, more empowering and which you gives you more ownership and clarity about your work, come and say hi!

**bio**
Hi, I am Pietro, I am here in Fuerte with colleagues thanks to a Nomads project of our company AgileLab, a consulting company in the Data space. I have a few years of experience in Data Science and lead teams delivering data projects in the Enterprise. I am passionate about tech communities and public speaking and I have been involved especially in the Python and PyData communities.


## setup

this repo uses atlas. if you have a recent nim installation (grab it with grabnim) you should be able to make it work with `atlas install`.
but it is the first time I am using atlas (and grabnim) so no idea if it actually works.
